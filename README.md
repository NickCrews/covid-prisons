Visualizing the spread of coronavirus in US prisons

<<<<<<< HEAD
Since the original article did not include any map visualization, I've created a map with the timeseries data to show how coronavirus case numbers have changed over time in different states' prisons. Not all graphics will render correctly in the GitHub preview. View the notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/william-rice/covid-prisons/blob/main/map_viz.ipynb) instead.
