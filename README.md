Visualizing the spread of coronavirus in US prisons

Since the original article did not include any map visualization, I've created a map with the timeseries data to show how coronavirus case numbers have changed over time in different states' prisons. 

See the map by itself [here](https://william-rice.github.io/covid-prisons/).

And how to build the map in this [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/william-rice/covid-prisons/blob/main/map_viz.ipynb).

Data from the Marshall Project.
