Visualizing the spread of coronavirus in US prisons

Since the original article did not include any map visualization, I've created a map with the timeseries data to show how coronavirus case numbers have changed over time in different states' prisons. Not all graphics will render correctly in the GitHub preview. View the notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/william-rice/covid-prisons/blob/main/map_viz.ipynb) instead.

Data from the [Marshall Project](https://github.com/themarshallproject/COVID_prison_data).

[Here](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons) is the original Marshall Project article.
